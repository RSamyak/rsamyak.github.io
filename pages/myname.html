My name is Rajanala Samyak, abbreviated to R Samyak.
</br>
</br>
My given name is Samyak, a Sanskrit <i>avyay</i> roughly meaning balanced / not too much and not too less.  It's a significant part of Jain teachings (though I'm not a Jain).  My surname/family name is Rajanala, named after an ancestral village.  According to Telugu naming convention, my surname appears before my given name.  In Telugu names, the surname is in the genitive case<sup>1</sup>.  The system of family names preceding the given name is common to some Chinese naming conventions as well.

I prefer 'Rajanala Samyak' over 'Samyak Rajanala', but I usually will not fuss over it.  In case you are reading this, then you are in the .1&#37 of my acquaintances that has bothered to find out.  Thank you.
