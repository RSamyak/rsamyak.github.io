My name is Rajanala Samyak, abbreviated to R Samyak.
</br>
My given name is Samyak, a Sanskrit <i>avyay</i> word roughly meaning balanced / not too much and not too less.  It's a significant part of Jain teachings (though I'm not a Jain).  My surname/family name is Rajanala, named after an ancestral village.  According to Telugu naming convention, my surname appears before my given name.  I prefer 'Rajanala Samyak' over 'Samyak Rajanala'.
</br>
In Telugu names, the surname is in the genitive case<sup>1</sup>.  The system of family names preceding the given name is common to some Chinese naming conventions as well.
